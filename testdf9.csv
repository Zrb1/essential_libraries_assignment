Baseball is a bat-and-ball game
played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding.
The game proceeds
"when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher,"
throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat
The objective of the offensive team
"is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases"
having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called runs
